Microsoft decided to provide Excel Online with the Office Scripts macro language, not VBA. The reason for that was because  the next generation of coders are already familiar with JavaSccript. More so than Python. JavaScript  is almost completely the same as TypeScript. TypeScript is the language the Office Scripts is based on. Also, most web app and web page coding is done in JavaScript. Power Automate, the event handling side of Office Scripts, requires some knowledge of web app development (VBA does not require any). So, JavaScript is the natural choice for the web-based version of Excel.
