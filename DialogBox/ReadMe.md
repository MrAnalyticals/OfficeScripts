**How to Add adialog box to your Excel Office Scripts Code**


Using the built in data validation functionality in Excel we can obtain a dialog box. We can control where it appears, what it displays and for how long it displays for. 
The only thing we can;t control is its size. But either way it is possible to display a dialog box at any point in yout OFfice Script code to notify the user of critical 
points of your code or actions required to be do by the user.

**The Demo 2 script **
We have a table on this sheet. We click the script button and it creates an image of a pie chart based on the invice totals on the table. If there are more than zero invoices the chart is created and a dialog box displays for a set time of 5 seconds. If there are no invoices the dialog box displays a different message.
