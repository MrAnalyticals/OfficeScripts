Customer Use Case Number 1
Excel Office Scripts demo. 
In this example demo the requirement was to add summation formulas to Excel 
in specific locations adding the data for each column. The location of each summation formula would change 
dynamically each time the report was created. So, the Office Script had to search the data set for 
the correct location. It did this by relying on the consistancy of the structure of the table and data within 
the worksheet. This demo shows how to use loops within Office Scripts and how to set formulas in the worksheet.
