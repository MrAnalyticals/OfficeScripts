The Office Scripts Scrabble Â® Solver uses the following Microsoft tools :  Office Scripts, Power Automate, OneDrive for Business and Excel Online. Just like in Scrabble the player has a set of tiles on their rack which they must find a word from. The number of combinations possible from 7 tiles (characters) is 5,568. For 6 characters it is 1,584. Given medium strong players already know all the 2 letter words, this script, does not supply all the possible two letter words. The script ends at the three letter word level.
