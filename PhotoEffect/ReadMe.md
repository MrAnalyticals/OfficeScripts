In this demo I use Office Scripts to create a grid of coloured cells using a custom HEX colouring function using a random variable. 
A photo is inserted into the worksheet on top of the coloured grid and its transparency setting is changed to allow the colours of 
the cells to show through.

The video demoing this can be found at  :
