Audio Script

In this demo I supply an Office script solution that generates passwords that adhere to in house company rules. I have created a script that accepts 6 parameters as follows: Password length, upper-case letters, lower-case letters, alphabetical sequence of letters, numerical sequence of numbers and, finally, special characters. I have included the script as well as the workbook in this GitHub repo. I hope you make good use of this script.
