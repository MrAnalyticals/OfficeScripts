**InHouse Rules Password Generator using Excel Office Scripts**

Many websites and systems have moved towards mandatory complex password usage. The rules make it very hard and time consuming to generate these passwords. Some businesses have additional rules including preventing passwords that look too similar to previous passwords. Together with the supplied Workbook this script will not only save you time but reduce one's stress levels.  

**In-House Rules**
The supplied script uses the following rules:

•	Must contains at least one digit

•	Must contain one at least one upper case letter

•	Must contain at least one lower case letter

•	No sequence of letters such that they are alphabetically consequative for example abc or bcd or defg or rstu.

•	No sequence of integers such that they are consequative for example 12 or 123, 456, 6789.

•	Must contain at least one of the following characters !, ”, £, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), _, -, ',', , ., :, ;, ?, /, @, ’, ¬, `,, |, \, +, , =, {, [, }, ], @, ’, ~, #

In this demo I supply an Office script solution that generates passwords that adhere to in house company rules. I have created a script that accepts 6 parameters as follows: Password length, upper-case letters, lower-case letters, alphabetical sequence of letters, numerical sequence of numbers and, finally, special characters. I have included the script as well as the workbook in this GitHub repo. I hope you make good use of this script.
